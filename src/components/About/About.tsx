          Lead Software Engineer with more than 10 years of experience
          delivering production software. My work combines hands-on Java and
          Spring Boot development with AWS architecture, infrastructure as
          code, CI/CD and operational ownership.

          I lead technical delivery, make architecture decisions and coordinate
          internal teams and external suppliers. I take responsibility for
          systems throughout their lifecycle, from early requirements and
          design through deployment, monitoring and production support.
